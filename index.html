		<h3 id = "about">About me</h3>
        <p> Hey, I'm Divij! <br>
            I currently live in Chicago, IL. <br>
            I'm a data scientist and policy analyst, currently enrolled in the MS in Computational Analysis and Public Policy at the University of Chicago. <br>
            I am currently a Research Engineer at the Mansueto Institute for Urban Innovation, at the University of Chicago. Previously, I've had the privilege of working at the Urban Informatics Lab at the Indian Institute for Human Settlements. <br>
            Throughout my career, I've been driven by the belief that technology, when thoughtfully applied, can be a powerful tool for public good. My experiences have spanned across data science, policy analysis, and urban informatics, each reinforcing my commitment to using data for societal improvement. <br>
            I am seeking opportunities to apply my skills in real-world settings, collaborating with peers, academics, and industry professionals. I'm particularly interested in projects at the intersection of technology, data science, and social justice, aiming to contribute to equitable and effective public policies.<br>
            I have mainly worked with public data, trying to glean more information from it, come up with methods to fill data gaps and turn it into publically consumable media. 
            I looked at migration patterns across India, came up with novel ways of projecting Indian populations (national, state, district and city) and looked at health indicators across underserved communities. <br>
			In 2019, I graduated from BITS Pilani, Goa with a major in Electrical Engineering and a minor in Politics, Economics and Philosophy. 
            I am interested in working on inter-disciplinary research between STEM and Public Policy.  <br> 
			Previously, I have worked as a Data Science Intern at Genpact and as a Research Intern at the North Eastern Space Applications Center, Department of Space.
            I am also fond of sports, sports analytics, trivia, film, comics and graphic design. <br>
