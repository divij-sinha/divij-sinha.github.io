		<h3 id = "about">About me</h3>
        <p> I currently live and work in Bengaluru, India. <br>
		    In 2019, I graduated from BITS Pilani, Goa with a major in Electrical Engineering and a minor in Politics, Economics and Philosophy. 
            I am interested in working on inter-disciplinary research between STEM and Public Policy. I work as a Research Assistant at the Urban Informatics Lab at the <a href="https://www.iihs.co.in" target="new">Indian Institute for Human Settlements</a>. 
            I mainly work with public data, trying to glean more information from it, come up with methods to fill data gaps and turn it into publically consumable media. 
            Currently, I am looking at migration patterns across India, coming up with novel ways of projecting Indian populations (national, state, district and city) and looking at health indicators across underserved communities. <br> 
			Previously, I have worked as a Data Science Intern at Genpact and as a Research Intern at the North Eastern Space Applications Center, Department of Space.
            I am also fond of sports, sports analytics, trivia, film, comics and graphic design. <br>
